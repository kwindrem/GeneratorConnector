The Generator Connector mechanism connects the generator digital input
to the generator control's manual start
When the digial input changes to the running state,
Venus Manual Start is changed to true if there are no automatic run conditions
hen the digital input changes to the not running,
Venus Manual Start is changed to false

The Generator Overview page is also modified to show 
the generator running state inside the icon top left
and a warning when the generator digital input and expected generator state disagree

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/GeneratorConnector/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/GeneratorConnector-current /data/GeneratorConnector

If not, do the following a computer that does have internet access

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/GeneratorConnector/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/GeneratorConnector-current

mv /data/GeneratorConnector-current /data/GeneratorConnector


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or click on this link in a web browser:

https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.

mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

Note, you must do GeneratorConnector and SetupHelper on a separate flash drive since they use
the same file name on the flash drive.

If you are installing multiple packages, SetupHelper need only be installed once.

Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/GeneratorConnector/setup

A reboot may be required following installation of some components, most notably device overlays.

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.

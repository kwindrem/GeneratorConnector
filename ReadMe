The Generator Connector mechanism connects the generator digital input
to the generator control's manual start
When the digial input changes to the running state,
Venus Manual Start is changed to true if there are no automatic run conditions
hen the digital input changes to the not running,
Venus Manual Start is changed to false

The Generator Overview page is also modified to show 
the generator running state inside the icon top left
and a warning when the generator digital input and expected generator state disagree

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

Copy the entire repo from GitHub as a zip file to /data on the Venus device
then unzip it. This should populate /data/VeCanSetup with the package contents.

You must also install SetupHelper from here:

https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper-for-VenusOs

Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
./setup
A reboot may be required following installation of some components, most notably device overlays.

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
